Finally, people have started to live again due to the collective efforts of the people to rejuvenate this natural heritage, now the name of the river has started to live again, the origin of the river was also developed by Amrit Sarovar's Tor of Amrit Sarovar.This river canal lake is going on only water It is not only crying, but it is also attached to the color and feelings of life, one such scene is seen in Maharashtra just a few days ago, during testing a few days ago, water was left in the canal during testing, during this time there were lies as if there were lies.Holi Diwali festival, friends, I will also remember Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj today, along with the valor of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, he gets to learn a lot from his governor and his management skills, especially Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj regarding water management and new C.The work that did even today The pride of Indian history increases, the Jaladurg made by him is still standing in the middle of the sea even after so many centuries.
